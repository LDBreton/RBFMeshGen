        Processes polygons to prepare them for point generation by classifying
        them into outer polygons and holes, and then refining them to ensure
        that they are properly nested and non-overlapping. This method sets up
        the initial geometric configuration by finding polygons based on the
        provided borders, classifying them based on orientation, and generating
        points along these borders.

        The method performs several key operations:
        1. Identifies and orients polygons based on the input borders, distinguishing
           between counter-clockwise (outer polygons) and clockwise (holes).
        2. Generates points along each border and collects these points, noting
           which are on boundary borders.
        3. Resolve overlaps among multiple polygons by calculating unique and intersecting areas.
        4. Subtracts hole polygons from outer polygons to finalize distinct regions.
        5. Combines region boundaries, preserving internal interfaces, to filter
           border samples that remain after hole subtraction.

                                  including internal interfaces, within the absolute tolerance.

        This setup is crucial for ensuring that the subsequent point generation by `generate_points`
        occurs within properly defined and non-overlapping geometric regions.
